# React Beginner Tutorial

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. It is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

## Why React?

React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

## What we will do in this tutorial?

In this tutorial, we will be builing a real-world application using React. We will build a simple cars showroom application. You can check the live demo of the application [here](https://react-tutrial.onrender.com).

## How to take this tutorial?

<details>
<summary>Method One</summary>

1. Clone the quick start branch of the repository

   ```bash
   git clone --single-branch --branch quick-starter https://github.com/moundhermesfar/react-tutrial.git

   ```

2. Change the directory to the cloned repository

   ```bash
   cd react-tutrial
   ```

3. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

</details>
<br/>
<details>
<summary>Method Two</summary>

1. You can start by creating a new React app using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest react-tutorial --template react
   ```

2. That will create a new React app in a folder called `react-tutorial`. You can then change the directory to the newly created folder and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd react-tutorial
   npm install
   ```

   </details>
   <br />

> Note: we will be using vite as our build tool in this tutorial. check the vite documentation [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## What will you learn?

You will find a separate branch for each lesson in this tutorial. Each branch will contain the code for that lesson.<br/>
if you want to clone the repository with all the branches, you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moundhermesfar/react-tutrial.git
```

if you want to clone a specific branch, you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch <branch-name> https://github.com/moundhermesfar/react-tutrial.git
```

> Replace the **branch-name** with the name of the branch you want to clone.
